A repo with a bunch of code and notes pertaining to computer science
## Structure of this repo.

### Courses from [MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu)
* 6.000 - Introduction to Computer Science
* 6.001 - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* 6.006 - Introductio to Algorithms
* 6.046 - Intermediate Algorithms
* 6.851 - Advanced Data Structures

Each course is in a directory.
Each directory is divded into directories labled `lec + {lecture-number}`
For each lecture there is a `notes.txt` or `.md` with personal notes taken during the lecture

Optionally if there is compilible code such as C code the compiled binaries will be in a dir called `bin`

Its a start but there is more to come
